# Humanity's Last Stand

This is a game that I have made as a submission to the [GameDevTV Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2024).

You can play the game [HERE](https://piet-de-leeuw.github.io/Humanitys-Last-Stand/)
or on Itch.io [HERE](https://kolibrie.itch.io/humanitys-last-stand)
[See Source Code](Scripts)

We had 10 days to Create a game with the theme: Last Stand!
I Chose to use Unity, C# and Visual studio to create my game.

The jam had the following rules:
- Games must be submitted by June 3rd, the end of the game jam.
- You can build a game solo or with a team. If you're on a team, one person is the designated uploader, and the max team limit size is 6 people.
- Free assets only! Using paid assets is NOT allowed, but free assets and those under an open source license like CC0 are allowed. Note: this doesn't include paid assets that you got for free, only freely available assets are allowed.
- Buggy submissions are okay! Hotfix patches are allowed after the deadline if you want to fix bugs.

## What I Learned From The Jam:
During those 10 days I didnâ€™t think enough about how to structure my code before writing it. This taught me a lot about how important planning is. Because I didn't plan much, at the end of the 10 days, my code was hard to add to and hard to navigate. This showed me that without planning code can become unmanageable even in a short amount of time and on small projects. So that is definitely  a great learning point!
